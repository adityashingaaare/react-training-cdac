to start react project 
 > npm start

 By default our project runs on 
    localhost:3000

In react default app.js

what is component in react
    - it is partial part of your app 
    - In react we have two types of component
        1. function component : when your main focus is UI design
        2. class component : when we have implement complex logic then it is
                             advisable to use class component.


How to ger view or output of indivisual component 
    - copy that component name and write as tag wherver you want.


jsx : it makes react code easy and allow is to write html code in react
    -in js we must have one parent element to wrap another 
     multiple element. Parent element could be <div>, <p> or any block element.


props :
    - it is parameter or functional parameter which is used to pass data inside
    parameter.
    -prop returns object type data to us.
    -In function component we access props with {props.propName}
    - in class component we access props with {this.props.propName}

State :
    - it used to handle and manage essential data in class component.
    - State returns as object type of data
    - state is available in only class component.

setState() : 
    -Used to manipulate state data


destructuring() :
    -creating constant variable to store data in it
    -we can destructure state as well as props 


Events and function in React 
onclick Event
onMouseOver


Conditional rendering (display component)
    1.if-else
    2.element as variable
    3.ternary operator
    4.short circuit : if the condition is true then only o/p will be shown


How to apply css to the react


React.fragment 
    it is an alternative for jsx. 
    It removes unwanted elements from react.


Component interactions
    getting one component data into another component
    for this in between two component they must have parent child relationship
    to establish parent child relation between component name inside parent component inside the render method



Virtual DOM 
    in react, instead of manipulating browser DOM directly, react creates 
Virtual DOM in memory where it does all the necessary changes required in browser DOM.

How to use bootstrap in React


Pure Component 
    it prevents unwanted re rendering of component
    it performs shallow comparison
    it works only in class component
    extend component with pureComponent class

React.memo()
     it prevents unwanted re rendering of function component


ref :
    it allows us to access DOM notes directly as well as its values

    How to use ref:
        Create ref variable
        Assign to an element
        access it wherever you want

Error Boundary
   - react component which used to handle errors in component
   - it contains two component lifecycle method to handle errors
        1. getDerivedStateFromError - it is static method and get called 
        automatically when error is ocurred.
        2. componentDidCatch - it displays error-log.

    
Form validation 
    we use regular expression

    -Routing : display component view or output by writing its path in browser url
                to perform routing in react, react-router-dom library must be installed.
            -npm i react-router-dom 
            import {BrowserRouter,Routes,Route} from 'react-router-dom';
                in react routing we have to use three directories:
                    1.browser-router : 
                    2.routes :
                    3.route :

            1.Naming Routing :
            2.Default Routing : 
            3.parameterized Routing : passing parameter with pathname 
            4.child Routing : defining one router another router

            wild card routing : 
            -when user adds wrong path in browser then it redirect to this component
            -it is denoted by *
            -it must be last routing in routing path


React bootstrap: 
    npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap


Component lifecycle method
    it is available only in class component
    it is divided into four phases
        1. Mounting Phase : it executes when class is initialized
            -constructor
            -getDerivedStateFromProps : used to assign data from props to state

            -render : renders data on browser
            -componentDidMount : it executes once after render method
        
        2.Update Phase: When we Update/manipulate DOM, Update phase executes
            -constructor : when component/object gets initialized 
            -shouldComponentUpdate : it decides whether the component will Update DOM value or notes. it return boolean value
            -render
            -getSnapShotBeforeUpdate : return DOM value before updating

            -componentDidUpdate : return DOM value after updating

        3. Unmounting Phase: 
            -componentWillunmount : it will execute just before removing component, it disconnects the connection with database server and the other components
        
        4. Error Phase:
            -getDerivedStateFromError
            -componentDidCatch

React Hooks: 
    -Allows us to use state and other class component features in function component.
    -It works only in function component. 
    -It introduced in react 16..
    -There are total 8 hooks..

        useState() - it allows us to use hook in function component.
                     from useState() hook, we extract two things (values) 
                        1. currentState: 
                        2. function to manipulate state:
                    in useState() hook, you can pass number, string, boolean, array, object type of data.

        useEffect(callback-function,dependency) :
                    -it is used to perform side effect amd action in function
                    -it can perform fetching data, direct DOM manipulation
        
        install json server
                > install i json-server -g
        create database file on json-server 
        access db folder
        json-server --watch -p 8888 db.json => start json server


        install axios library : allows us to make request (get,put,post,delete) from client to server
        >npm i axios
        
        we make get request

        use font awesome icon
        >npm i font-awesome

        Redux 
    it is used to store manage and track state of js apps
    it is open source javascript library

    it works on three main concepts-
        1. store : It holds state of application
        2. action : It describes changes with state
        3. reducer : It actually carry out state transition depending on store and action

    install Redux
    >npm i Redux
